- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hartviger
- 👀 I'm interested in the human body, how it works as one big, great organism, with one of the most incredible and complex units known to mankind, the brain.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computational Biomedicine, right now I'm creating plots for a upcomping Shiny app. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever interesting projects about the human body that involve programming. I'm most confident in using RStudio. 
- 📫 How to reach me: write to me at my privat email, or my student email: jakobhartvigprivat@gmail.com | jahar21@student.sdu.dk.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing computer games and workout.
